## Take Home Coding Challenge: NYC Schools

### Requirements

The app requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with a wide variety of functional solutions. Feel free to be creative and impress with code and UX (see more details below). You are allowed to use all online resources you can find and any 3rd party libraries if desired. Remember to make it useful for an actual user/student.

Create a web app (preferably React and Typescript) to provide information on NYC High Schools.

1. Display a list of NYC High Schools
2. Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2
3. Check this api - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/s3k6-pzi2.json
4. Selecting a school should show additional information about the school
5. Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading, and Writing.
6. SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4
7. It is up to you to decide what additional information to display.

In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

### What Is Important

- Meet the basic app requirements
- The app should work like it would in production - error handling, edge conditions, stability, and speed are important.
- Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah parter blah blah)).
- Proper architecture with separation of concerns and best-practice patterns.
- Modern asynchronous programming techniques.

### What Is Less Important

- Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
- Only add code which you want us to read and evaluate.

### Bonus Points!

- Good UX and UI
- Samples of unit testing. Examples of types of tests you would write rather than 100% code coverage.
Demonstrate understanding of development with accessibility in mind: samples of code that address one or more WCAG principles and/or a specific WCAG checkpoint. We are not looking for a complete coverage, but rather for a sample of ADA compliant code.
